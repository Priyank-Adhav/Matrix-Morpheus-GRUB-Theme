# Matrix Morpheus GRUB Theme
**Red Pill vs Blue Pill**

A minimalist Matrix-inspired GRUB theme featuring full-screen dynamic backgrounds that change between Linux and Windows.

---

⚠️ **Note:**  
Currently, the theme only includes the **Arch Linux** icon.  
 
Also, while the icons are **arranged horizontally** on screen,  
you still navigate using the **Up** and **Down arrow keys** as in a normal GRUB menu.
